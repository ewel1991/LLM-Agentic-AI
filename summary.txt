Hi! I’m Ewelina Bęben. I work as a Project Coordinator at GOLDBECK Comfort, where I get to combine organisation with real-world impact on construction and facility projects. I’m originally from Poland and have always been fascinated by processes that turn ideas into built environments.

I love problem-solving and tackling challenges head-on — whether it’s coordinating tasks, working with diverse teams, or making sure things just flow the way they should. Outside of work, I’m a big fan of exploring new places and staying active, especially when it involves a bit of fresh air and good company. I love eating dumplings and trying out new food!
